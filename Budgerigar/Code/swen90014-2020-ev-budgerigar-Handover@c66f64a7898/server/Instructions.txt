Docker and Docker-compose should be installed on the system. From server/Scripts/
    ./installDocker-compose.sh
    ./installDocker.sh

Obtain valid SSL certificates, and update path in server/Scripts/installSSLCerts.sh -> SSL_CERT_DIR=''.
Then, from server/Scripts/

    sudo ./installServer.sh

The server is divided into 2 levels:	Api-container 
										service-container + DB
When the server is started, multiple docker images are built and inter-connected through internal networks.
To run entire server 
    - cd server/
    - runServer.sh  -> starts all services
    - Scripts/stopServer.sh -> stops all services
    
The above commands executes 'docker-compose' inside each of the 'Api-container/' and 'service-container/' folders. All services then start in the background.
To run these services in the foreground, remove the '-d' flag from line 5 of cleanRunContainer.sh in both of the above folders.

3 API endpoints available : 
https://machine-ip/register/user
    Register API    -> Register service                                 -> Database
    
https://machine-ip/write/user
    Write API       -> Sign/Verification Service    -> Write service    -> Database
    
https://machine-ip/sync/user
    Synchronize API -> Sign/Verification Service    -> Sync service     -> Database

For development, an extension to manage PostgreSQL has been added called 'Adminer'. 
To access PostgreSQL through Adminer -> browser->localhost:8080
