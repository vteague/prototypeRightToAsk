# prototypeRightToAsk
This is a prototype of the Right To Ask server, implemented by Ishan Goyal, Jack Macumber, Nicholas Montorio and Andrzej for their fourth year software engineering project at the University of Melbourne.

Note: if you're working on the project, this is **not** the repository for you - use the private one instead.

If you're interested in working on the project, please email me at vanessa [at] thinkingcybersecurity.com.

An open version will be posted here in early 2021.
